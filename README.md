## AIM:
To write a program to implement the K Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import Necesary Libraries.
2. Perform Basic operations.
3. Implement Kmeans Clustering fro the Model.
4. Plot the graph of cluster
